    <div class="col"><h3>BMW I8</h3>
    <P class="car">
      According to BMW, the i8 is the first high-performance sports car with the economy of a compact vehicle – and with its wind-cheating lines, it looks fast sitting still. The i8 is a plug-in car with an electric motor coupled to a two-speed transmission mounted up front that drives the front wheels. At the rear of the car, there’s a 1.5-litre turbocharged inline 3-cylinder powerplant that drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic. The two energy sources combined can make the i8 an all-wheel drive vehicle. Like its stable mate the i3, the i8 utilizes BMW’s LifeDrive architecture to provide an extremely low centre of gravity and 50:50 weight distribution. In eDrive mode, the car can be driven purely by electric power, or in Hybrid mode, both gas and electric motors work together to provide optimal drive characteristics, whether front, rear or all-wheel drive.

    <div class="col"><h3>ROLLS ROYCE GHOST</h3>
    <p class="car">On the subject of range, the Ghost Series II continues with its V12, twin-turbo engine. It pumps out 563-hp and 575 lb.-ft. of torque as it consumes untold litres per 100 kilometres. The upside is that it has the wherewithal to motivate several tons of shiny sheet metal from rest to 100 km/h in a scant 5.0 seconds.Inside, it is the epitome of bespoke. The cabin comes from another world — the quality is beyond belief. Mind you, on the specification sheet beside the Ghost II, Rolls-Royce listed a USB input and Bluetooth as options. I guess if you have to worry about the options it is, as the saying goes, out of one’s price range!</p></div>

    <div class="col"><h3>DODGE SRT CHALLENGER</h3>
    <p class="car">This version of the 2015 Dodge Challenger with a supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI engine is rated at 707 hp (527 kW) and 650 lb⋅ft (881 N⋅m) of torque. This engine is also available in the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat full-sized sedan, the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk SUV, and the Hellcrate engine swap kit. The inner driving light on the left front has been removed to allow air to get into the engine resulting in more torque, and the wheel wells are different from the standard SRT to accommodate the 20-inch aluminum wheels. The SRT Hellcat is equipped with two separate key fobs; use of the "black" fob limits engine output to 500 hp (373 kW), while the "red" fob enables full output capability.</p></div>

    <p class="car">Unveiled at the 2012 LA Auto Show,[75][76] with a market launch that began in June 2013.[77] the SLS AMG Black Series is a high-performance variant of the SLS AMG Coupé inspired by the SLS AMG GT3. Notable changes over the SLS AMG include increased engine power to 631 PS (464 kW; 622 hp) at 7,400 rpm and decreased torque to 635 N⋅m (468 lb⋅ft) at 5,500 rpm along with increased engine redline of 8,000 rpm, fully revised high-speed valvetrain with modified camshafts, adapted cam geometry and optimised bucket tappets having a special coating which is otherwise exclusive to racing cars, modification of the intake air ducts (derestriction and adaptation to the new maximum engine speed), adaptation of the engine application and increase in peak pressure.
